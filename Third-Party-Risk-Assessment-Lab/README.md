# Lab 1: Third-Party Risk Assessment

## Overview
This lab simulated a third-party risk assessment aligned with real-world vendor management practices, focusing on vendors handling PHI and HIPAA compliance requirements.

## Key Highlights
- Evaluated four vendors using a structured Excel risk matrix.
- Assigned **likelihood** and **impact** scores, calculated total risk (L×I).
- Proposed mitigation strategies (MFA, SOC 2, AES-256 encryption).
- Assessed **residual risk** after mitigation.

## Sample Vendors & Risks
- **Goku Cloud Scheduling Inc.** – High risk due to lack of MFA and missing SOC 2 (PHI exposure).
- **Zeta Data Analytics** – Moderate risk; no encryption at rest.
- **Nimbus Billing Solutions** – High priority; outdated SSL & missing BCP.
- **Elite HVAC** – Low sensitivity but remote access risk.
