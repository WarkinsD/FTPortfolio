## Labs and Projects

### 1. [Third-Party Risk Assessment](./Third-Party-Risk-Assessment-Lab)
Evaluated vendor cybersecurity risks (PHI exposure, MFA gaps, SOC 2 compliance) using a 5×5 risk matrix. Proposed mitigations and assessed residual risk for HIPAA and HITRUST alignment.

### 2. [Enterprise Risk Register](./Enterprise-Risk-Register-Lab)
Created an enterprise-wide risk register aligned with NIST SP 800-30, scoring internal threats across VPNs, HR systems, email, and endpoints.

### 3. [Microsoft Security Stack Summary](./Microsoft-Security-Stack-Lab)
Documented core use cases for Microsoft Defender, Azure AD, and Microsoft Sentinel, including KQL-based threat detection scenarios.

### 4. [HIPAA and HITRUST Compliance Mapping](./HIPAA-HITRUST-Compliance-Mapping-Lab)
Mapped HIPAA Security Rule safeguards to HITRUST CSF controls, demonstrating how operational security practices align with compliance frameworks.

### 5. [KQL Threat Hunting Toolkit](./KQL-Threat-Hunting-Toolkit-Lab)
Developed 11 tested KQL queries in Microsoft Sentinel for real-world threat detection (brute-force, privilege escalation, exfiltration). Includes full Markdown toolkit and screenshots.
