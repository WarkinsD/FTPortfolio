# HIPAA & HITRUST Compliance Mapping Lab

## Overview
This lab compares **HIPAA’s Security and Privacy Rules** with the **HITRUST CSF**, focusing on how HITRUST expands HIPAA’s safeguards with prescriptive controls and measurable auditability.

## Key Highlights
- **Enforcement:** HIPAA = regulatory baseline; HITRUST = certifiable, auditable framework.  
- **Control Depth:** HITRUST adds technical and administrative controls to HIPAA safeguards.  
- **Scope:** HIPAA protects PHI; HITRUST extends to organization-wide risk and third-party security.

## Sample Mappings
- **HIPAA 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) – Risk Analysis** → HITRUST 03.b (Formal risk assessments).  
- **HIPAA 164.312(a)(2)(i) – Unique User Identification** → HITRUST 01.b & 01.q (Formal user registration & authentication).  
- **HIPAA 164.308(a)(6)(ii) – Security Incident Procedures** → HITRUST 11.a–11.d (Incident detection, response, and lessons learned).

## Compliance Relevance
- Supports **HIPAA audits** and **HITRUST readiness assessments** by showing how controls map between frameworks.
