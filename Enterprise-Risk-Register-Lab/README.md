# Enterprise Risk Register

## Overview
This lab simulates the creation of an enterprise-wide risk register following **NIST SP 800-30** methodology. It evaluates internal cybersecurity risks by rating **likelihood** and **impact**, calculating risk scores, and proposing mitigation strategies.  

## Key Highlights
- Identified **five critical enterprise assets**: VPN Access, Shared File Drive, Employee HR Records, Email System, and Endpoint Devices.  
- Mapped relevant threats (phishing, ransomware, insider misuse, malware).  
- Assigned risk scores using a 1–5 scale (L×I).  
- Proposed mitigation strategies (MFA, email filtering, EDR, backup/recovery).  
- Estimated residual risk after mitigation.

## Sample Risks & Scores
- **VPN Access – Credential Theft** → Risk Score: 25 (**Very High**)  
- **Shared File Drive – Ransomware** → Risk Score: 20 (**Very High**)  
- **Employee HR Records – Insider Misuse** → Risk Score: 12 (**Moderate**)  
- **Email System – Phishing** → Risk Score: 16 (**High**)  
- **Endpoint Devices – Malware Infection** → Risk Score: 9 (**Low**)

## Compliance Relevance
- Supports **HIPAA & HITRUST** principles for protecting sensitive data.  
- Aligns with **NIST SP 800-30** for enterprise risk assessment.
